# Train VAE

~/outDir should exist beforehad (or create it in the feed_loop if it does not exist)
train.slurm should be run from another dir (please change accordinlgly the path inside train.slurm), because it produces the slurm log files

the embedding code still to be added (based on the output of training models, the user decides which model to use for embedding,  so it is another script) . Or you can embed based on all models, that is a lot of plots
