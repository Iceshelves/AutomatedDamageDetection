# Automated Damage Detection
Prototype for automated damage detection in Sentinel 1 imaging of iceselves using unsupervised learning.

The prototype makes use of a VAE architecture, and employs a bespoke input genertation framework  to create cutouts for network training from larger imaging tiles.  
Notebooks have been used for intial prototyping. These have been converted to scripts for a first prouction prototype.
